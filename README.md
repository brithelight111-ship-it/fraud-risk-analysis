# Fraud Risk Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes synthetic financial transaction data to identify patterns associated with fraudulent behavior. The goal is to demonstrate analytical thinking, SQL querying, and data visualization skills relevant to fraud and risk analyst roles.

## Business Questions
- Which transaction types have the highest fraud rates?
- How does transaction amount relate to fraud risk?
- Do device and IP risk scores effectively predict fraud?
- Are there time-based patterns in fraudulent activity?

## Data Source
Synthetic Financial Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets (data cleaning, pivots, dashboards)
- Google BigQuery (SQL analysis)
- GitHub (version control and project presentation)

## Key Findings
- High-value transactions carry disproportionately higher fraud risk
- Risk scores strongly correlate with fraudulent outcomes
- Fraud activity varies by transaction type and time of day

## SQL Analysis
